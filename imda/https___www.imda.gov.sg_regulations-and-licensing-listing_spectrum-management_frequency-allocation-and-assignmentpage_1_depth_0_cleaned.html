            <p><span>IMDA manages the frequency allocation and assignment for commercial and government spectrum usage per IMDA regulations. The radio frequency spectrum is divided into bands allocated for different types of services. </span></p>
<p><span>For spectrum bands recommended by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), specific channeling plans may be adopted for assignment. Assignment refers to the subdivision of the spectrum in which a licensee is permitted to use part of the spectrum assigned to operate a telecommunication network on a specific channel or group of channels at a particular location under specific conditions.</span></p>
<p><span>As the radio frequency spectrum is a limited resource and increasing number of wireless mobile services, international coordination of spectrum is important as a part of the spectrum allocation process.</span></p>
