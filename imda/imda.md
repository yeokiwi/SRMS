# Frequency Allocation & Assignment

IMDA manages the frequency allocation and assignment for commercial and government spectrum usage per its regulations. The radio frequency spectrum is divided into bands allocated for different types of services.

For spectrum bands recommended by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), specific channeling plans may be adopted for assignment. Assignment refers to the subdivision of the spectrum where a licensee is permitted to use part of the spectrum to operate a telecommunication network on a specific channel or group of channels at a particular location under specific conditions.

As the radio frequency spectrum is a limited resource with an increasing number of wireless mobile services, international coordination of spectrum is an important part of the allocation process.

The radio frequency spectrum is divided into frequency bands allocated to various radiocommunication services such as aeronautical, land mobile, meteorological and satellite communication services.

## Radio Spectrum Master Plan

The Radio Spectrum Master Plan (updating in progress) serves to inform the industry and interested parties on the availability of spectrum in the coming years, technological trends in the use of spectrum, and IMDA's policy direction and regulations with regard to spectrum allocation and re-allocation for public communication networks.

The Singapore Spectrum Management Handbook provides detailed information on spectrum management.

## Use of Frequencies for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)

Short-range devices (SRDs) are low-powered radio transmitters with a localised area of operation, such as wireless microphones and remote controls. With the increasing adoption of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS, drones) for commercial and recreational uses, IMDA has published information to guide users on their safe operation in Singapore.
