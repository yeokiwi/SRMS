<h2>Re-employment by another employer</h2>
<p>If your employer is unable to re-employ you, your employer can transfer re-employment obligations to another employer upon meeting these two conditions:</p>
<p>You are not obliged to accept a re-employment offer by the new employer, and will be entitled to an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) from your present employer should you choose to turn down the offer.</p>
<p>You can take a look at this </p>
<h2>Employment Assistance Payment (EAP)</h2>
<p>If your employer has considered all available re-employment options within the organisation and is still unable to identify a suitable job for you, the company may offer you an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP).</p>
<p>The EAP is:</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Revised tripartite guidelines</h2>
<p>Following the release of the </p>
<p>These are the key changes to the revised guidelines:</p>
<div>
<h2><span>Part-time re-employment</span></h2>
<div>
<p>As an employer, you should adhere to prevailing principles on changes to wages, medical and other benefits for your employees who are re-employed on a part-time basis. You can tap on the </p>
<p>For re-employment of your part-time employees, the maximum and minimum EAP amounts could be pro-rated based on the number of hours worked per week, relative to a full-time employee.</p>
</div>
<h2><span>Higher internal retirement and re-employment ages than statutory requirements</span></h2>
<div>
<p>As an employer, you are encouraged to raise your internal retirement and re-employment ages above the statutory requirements.</p>
<p>These ages should be clearly documented in your relevant employment documents. You should also include avenues where your employees can seek help from if there are disputes.</p>
</div>
<h2><span>Structured career planning</span></h2>
<div>
<p>As an employer, you are encouraged to adopt a forward-looking approach in guiding your employees on career development, including the adoption of structured career planning for employees aged 45 years old and above.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>You will benefit through a deeper understanding of your employees’ future plans, and areas for development. They can build confidence in planning their careers, enhancing their skills and preparing for career changes, re-employment and eventual retirement.</p>
</div>
<h2><span>Job redesign</span></h2>
<div>
<p>As an employer, you should facilitate the re-employment of older workers by building more age-friendly workplaces.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to use job redesign to make organisation-wide and system-levels changes. This will increase the number of older workers who can perform the job, and increase the age at which your workers can do a job.</p>
</div>
<h2><span>Medical benefits</span></h2>
<div>
<p>As an employer, you should restructure existing medical benefits, and provide additional MediSave contributions or other flexible benefits. These can be used to pay for your employee’s MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plan premiums (if applicable).</p>
<p>This helps you manage healthcare costs by providing stability and predictability, and builds up Medisave Accounts and accrue medical benefits post-employment for your employees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Disputes</h2>
<p>You should work together with your employer (or union, if applicable) to resolve any differences amicably.</p>
<p>You can also approach the Commissioner for Labour (COL) or Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for help in the following situations:</p>
<div>
<h2><span>Not offered re-employment</span></h2>
<div>
<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>You are not offered re-employment and you dispute your employer’s reasons for it.</p>
<p>This could include not meeting the re-employment eligibility criteria, no suitable job vacancy, or dismissal during re-employment.</p>
<h3>When to approach</h3>
<p>Within <strong>1 month</strong> after the last day of employment.</p>
<h3>How to approach</h3>
<p>You can </p>
</div>
<h2><span>Unreasonable terms and conditions or EAP amount</span></h2>
<div>
<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>You feel that the terms and conditions of the re-employment offer or the EAP amount offered is unreasonable.</p>
<h3>When to approach</h3>
<p>Within <strong>6 months</strong> after the last day of employment.</p>
<h3>Who to approach</h3>
<p>You can approach </p>
