# Responsible re-employment

Employers must offer re-employment to eligible employees who reach the minimum retirement age, up to the re-employment age of 68. Find out if you are eligible, guidelines on re-employment and what to do if there is a dispute.

In accordance with the from 1 July 2022, the minimum retirement age is **63 years**. Employers are not allowed to dismiss any employee based on an employee’s age.

Employers must offer **re-employment** to eligible employees who turn 63, up to age 68, to continue their employment in the organisation. The re-employment age was raised from 67 to 68 from 1 July 2022 to help older workers who wish to continue working as long as they are willing and able to.

The retirement and re-employment ages are:

| Age | Retirement age | Re-employment age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Born on or before 30 June 1955 <br> (>67 years old on 1 July 2022) | 62 | 67 |
| Born on or after 1 July 1955 and up to 30 June 1960<br> (>62 to ≤67 years old on 1 July 2022) | 62 | 68 |
| Born on or after 1 July 1960<br> (≤62 years old on 1 July 2022) | 63 | 68 |

**Note:** The re-employment age will be raised to 69 years from 1 July 2026, which will apply to those born on or after 1 July 1958.

## Re-employment by another employer

If your employer is unable to re-employ you, your employer can transfer re-employment obligations to another employer upon meeting these two conditions:

You are not obliged to accept a re-employment offer by the new employer, and will be entitled to an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) from your present employer should you choose to turn down the offer.

## Employment Assistance Payment (EAP)

If your employer has considered all available re-employment options within the organisation and is still unable to identify a suitable job for you, the company may offer you an Employment Assistance Payment (EAP).

## Revised tripartite guidelines

These are the key changes to the revised guidelines:

### Part-time re-employment

As an employer, you should adhere to prevailing principles on changes to wages, medical and other benefits for your employees who are re-employed on a part-time basis. You can tap on the

For re-employment of your part-time employees, the maximum and minimum EAP amounts could be pro-rated based on the number of hours worked per week, relative to a full-time employee.

### Higher internal retirement and re-employment ages than statutory requirements

As an employer, you are encouraged to raise your internal retirement and re-employment ages above the statutory requirements.

These ages should be clearly documented in your relevant employment documents. You should also include avenues where your employees can seek help from if there are disputes.

### Structured career planning

As an employer, you are encouraged to adopt a forward-looking approach in guiding your employees on career development, including the adoption of structured career planning for employees aged 45 years old and above.

You will benefit through a deeper understanding of your employees’ future plans, and areas for development. They can build confidence in planning their careers, enhancing their skills and preparing for career changes, re-employment and eventual retirement.

### Job redesign

As an employer, you should facilitate the re-employment of older workers by building more age-friendly workplaces.

You are encouraged to use job redesign to make organisation-wide and system-levels changes. This will increase the number of older workers who can perform the job, and increase the age at which your workers can do a job.

### Medical benefits

As an employer, you should restructure existing medical benefits, and provide additional MediSave contributions or other flexible benefits. These can be used to pay for your employee’s MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plan premiums (if applicable).

This helps you manage healthcare costs by providing stability and predictability, and builds up Medisave Accounts and accrue medical benefits post-employment for your employees.

## Disputes

You should work together with your employer (or union, if applicable) to resolve any differences amicably.

You can also approach the Commissioner for Labour (COL) or Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for help in the following situations:

### Not offered re-employment

#### How to approach
